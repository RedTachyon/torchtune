# Implementation plan


Step by step todo:
- [x] Adapt generate_trajectory
- [ ] Adapt the training loop to a PPO/REINFORCE training loop

TODOs:

- Modify generate_trajectory to work with GRPO
- (maybe) try a REINFORCE version?
- Adapt the training loop for GRPO (interpolate between distributed SFT and single device RLHF PPO)
